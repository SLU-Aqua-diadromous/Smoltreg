## Dataflow from Smoltreg to Sötebasen

Data from the smolt traps are delivered in a Excel-file with a
predefined format. Usually this file is named
*Smoltreg_RIVER_YYYY_MM_DD.xlsx*. The file should contain the tabs:

1.  *Fiskdata* with data for the individual catches.
2.  *Metadata* Basic data about the location and active period of the
    trap.
3.  *Metadata2* Data needed by Sötebasen
4.  *Dagbok* (Optional) Daily logg with information of significant
    efents. Can also contain maually registered water temp and water
    flow.
5.  *Envlogger_water* Data from data logger (added by SLU see below)
6.  *Envlogger_land* Data from data logger (added by SLU see below)

In addition there should be two file from the temp/pressure loggers with
the file extension *.hobo*. This data must be quality checked for errors
and formatted into a format suitable for importing info *Sötebasen*. The
formatted file is sent to *Ålderslabb* that will add additional data
before the file is sent *Anders Kinnerbäck* to be imported into
*Sötebasen*.

All data from smolt traps are exported from Sötebasen into
*\\\\storage-dh.slu.se\\restricted\$\\Sötebasen\\Exporter\\Smoltfälla\*.csv*.
These .csv-files are later used as input for estimation of the total
smolt runs.

Package *Smoltreg* contains routines and a shiny-app that will
facilitate the error checking and finally format a file ready to be sent
to ålderslab

### Workflow

Make copies of the delivered data files for a smolt trap. You will find
the raw (as delivered) data files on the central file server
*\\\\storage-dh.slu.se\\restricted\$\\Lax\\Data\\YYYY\\Rådata\\RIVER*
(where *YYYY* and *RIVER* should be changed). You should have at least
an Excel file with fishdata and an file from the temp-pressure logger.

You must then compile one single Excel that contains several tabs with
specific tabs for fishdata, environmental data (temp and water level)
and metadata.

1.  Open your copy of the Excel file and make an initial check of the
    tab *Fiskdata*. The tab *Fiskdata* should be a list of fish
    observations.
2.  Do a quick scan of the data to find obvious error. For example check
    that the same date format, the prefered data format is *YY-MM-DD
    HH:MM*. Obvious errors should be fixed before you try to run the
    data checking script.
3.  Switch to tab *Metadata* and check that it is filled by the trap
    personel, otherwise fill it yourself (*Dummy tag:* is optional).
4.  Create a new tab named *Metadata2*. This tab contains fields that
    are required for the Sötebasen-import. Needed fields are: Metod,
    Beställare, Ansvarig, Syfte, Sekretess, Märkning and Signatur. See
    an example from previous year for an example.

### Adding loggerdata

#### Alt 1. You have data from HOBO loggers.

1.  Use HOBOware to convert the hobo data files to excel-files. One file
    from logger in the water and one from logger in the air. Make sure
    that to use SI-units (kPa and °C), only export data and no events.
2.  Add each file to a tab in the file. Name the tabs *Envlogger_water*
    and *Envlogger_land*.

The app will trim the data to include dates between start and stop date
(defined in tab Metadata), calculate water depth from the preassure and
calculate mean temp and depth for each day.

#### Alt 2. You have manually measured temp and level

If data from loggers for some reason isn't available you can use data
recorded maually or downloaded from the net.

1.  Add a sheet named *Miljödata* with three columns *date*, *w_level*
    and *w_temp*.
2.  Add your values to the *Miljödata* sheet. One row per date for the
    period the trap was active.

### Running the Smoltreg app

*Smoltreg::smoltregApp()* is a shiny-app that facilitates quality
assurance of the input file and formatting of a output file in the
format required by *Sötebasen*. The app will automatically fix some
errors, for example fix case of species names.

1.  Start the shiny app to sanity checks on the *Smoltreg*-file with the
    command *Smoltreg::smoltregApp()*.
2.  Check your file by clicking on the various buttons from top to
    bottom. Often errors are dependent on each other so start topmost
    test and fix errors as you go.
3.  Everytime you make changes reload the file and check evrything until
    all errors are eliminated.
4.  Finally the button "Save Sötebasen-file" can save a file suitable to
    import into Sötebasen.
