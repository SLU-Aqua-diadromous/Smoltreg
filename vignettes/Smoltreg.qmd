## Smoltreg

Package `Smoltreg` contains functions and a shiny app that can help with quality
assurance of data from our smolt traps. Quality assured data can be exported
to an Excel-file in a format suitable to import into SÃ¶tebasen.



To assist in the quality assurance of smolt data (used for mark/recapture studies and more)
several R-packages are available. This vignette in package _Smoltreg_ gives an overview
of the whole process from delivery of raw data from the traps to a human readable report with
assesment of smolt production for a river.

To install `Smoltreg` run:
```{r install_stuff, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
remotes::install_github("SLU-Aqua-diadromous/Smoltreg", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

A longer vignette describing the full workflow is available on: <https://slu-aqua-diadromous.github.io/Smoltreg/articles/workflow.html>
